# Prisma-Boilerplate

Boilerplate project with dependencies that are required to start Prisma based application development

# Project Setup

1. `npm install -g prisma`
2. install docker-compose library
3. Update `docker-compose.yml` with your local database information
4. `npm install` to install all required node packages
5. `docker-compose up` to run prisma server

## Dependencies

## Development Steps

This application will be using locally deployed database `postgres` and schema 'boilerplate'
Follow steps from https://www.prisma.io/docs/get-started/01-setting-up-prisma-new-database-TYPESCRIPT-t002/

### Changes made for boilerplate

1. Updated docker-compose.yml to use locally hosted postgres database

### Extra Knowledge

1. `docker-compose up -d`
   1. This will deploy Prisma Server on `localhost:4466` and Prisma API
2. `prisma init --endpoint http://localhost:4466`
   1. Will create two files `prisma.yml` and `datamodel.prisma`
3. `prisma deploy`
   1. Will deploy prisma API 2. Migrates types to database
   2. Prisma Admin will be available on http://localhost:4466/\_admin
   3. Now database will have a default table created [user]
   4. http://localhost:4466 will be available for mutations, types, queries etc.]
4. `prisma generate`
   1. Will create prisma client inside `./generated/prisma-client/`
5. In `index.ts` prisma client API is being used; which is a wrapper on Prisma API hosted on Prisma Server

## Database Schema

Schema covers `n:m`, `1:m` and parent child relationships
For example, only Equipment has,

1. one to many relationship with Equipment Properties
2. many to many relationship with Equipment Class
3. parent child relationship with it self

All of these types are written in datamodel.prisma file
